# Etch-a-Sketch

Created for The Odin Project's Web Development Foundation's Project: Etch-a-Sketch (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch)


The assignment called for using JavaScript to create a grid of a given number of divs in which the user could draw by moving the mouse.  The project also required allowing the user to specify a new number of divs inside the grid without resizing the grid.  The optional part of the assignement involved having each div change to a random color as the mouse passed over it and then gradually darken to black.


## What I learned:

This project really reinforced for me the importance of trying out functions, methods, etc in a fiddle before integrating them into my code.  Another thing I learned was that describing what I was trying to do with my code and what was happening with my code in plain English helped me to understand what I was doing and what I needed to do next.  Finally, working on this project reinforced the fact that after taking a break, I was often able to solve a problem that had felt unsoluable before the break.
